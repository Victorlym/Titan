#I designed an interactive web page that can  improve  personal experience for people who want to find events. 
I designed content-based algorithms recommendation for recommend events. 
I use  AJAX technology (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) for front-end.
The back-end includes a database and a java service to process data.I Implemented Java servlets using RESTful APIs for HTTP requests and responses. And I built relational and NoSQL databases with MongoDB.
Then I deployed the server side to Amazon EC2 to handle QPS tested by Apache JMeter
